# SteamShutdown
Automatic shutdown after Steam downloads have finished.

## What is it?

First program which uses actual steam metadata which indicates directly what downloads are still running.  
I don't use some hack like tracking hard drive or network usage.  
So this is the actual first really reliable program which shutdowns the PC if all steam download have finished.

## Usage
It has a "two-columns-design".  
The right column contains tracked downloads and vice-versa. If all tracked download finished, the pc will shutdown.
