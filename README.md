# SteamShutdown
Automatic shutdown after Steam downloads have finished.

## What is it?

First program that uses actual steam metadata which indicates directly what downloads are still running.  
I don't use any hack like tracking the hard drive or the network usage.  
So this is the first reliable program that shutdowns the PC as soon as all steam downloads have finished.

## Usage
SteamShutdown has no real GUI. It's only an icon in the taskbar. Click it to see the menu.
